# Binary-Unsorted-Tree

This project have one interface called Node and a class TreeDataStructure.
Also, there is testClass where I tested the code.

The program consists in reading a file an added in an unsorted binary tree using recursion.
The purspose of this program is the use of recursion and the idea of interface.
The interface help to create an uncommon binary tree.
